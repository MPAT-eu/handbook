## Quickstart ##

The quickstart section outlines how to build an MPAT application – quickly. Necessary steps are listed subsequently and will be explained in detail in the consecutive sections below.

**Quickly create an HbbTV with MPAT:**

- Choose a Navigation Model
- Create a Page Layout
  - Load a background image
  - Define a component layout by adding boxes
  - Save as draft / Publish the Page Layout
- Create a Page (repeat as many as necessary)
  - Select a Page Layout
  - Add background image
  - Customize the content component(s)
    - Add text
    - Add image
    - Add video
    - Add hotspots
    - Add a menu
    - Add a link
  - Save as draft / Publish the Page
- Configure the Navigation
  - Define Start Page
  - SlideFlow - Define Order of Pages
  - Website - Add links between pages
- Customize the Application
- Publish the application by publishing all pages

**Note:** If you use Firefox both for editing and previewing, you will have to disable FireHbbTV every time you go back to editing:
- Enabled – The TV icon is blue:
- Disabled – The TV icon is black:
If you do not disable the Add-on when editing, the editor will not work properly. 

*Workaround*: Use Chrome or any other Internet browser that does not support FireHbbTV add-on for editing and use Firefox with the FireHbbTV add-on for previewing only.
