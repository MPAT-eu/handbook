## Requirements and First Steps ##

### Software Setup ###

A standard Internet browser like Google Chrome (Version), Mozilla Firefox (Version) or MS Internet Explorer (Version) is required **to use the MPAT editor tool** and to start creating HbbTV applications.

In order **to preview the HbbTV applications** , Mozilla Firefox v51.0.1as well as the Firefox Add-on FireHbbTV v1.3.20are needed. This Add-on must be switched on in order to preview the HbbTV application and must be switched off in order to edit the application with MPAT.

**Note** : To simplify the workflow we therefore recommend using one browser that does not use FireHbbTV for editing and a Firefox browser with FireHbbTV.

**Todo:** Download **Mozilla Firefox v51.0.1** or newer:

+ Verify the version you have installed:
	+ Select *open menu*
  	+ Select the question mark (*?*)
  	+ Check the version number

Install Firefox Add-on **FireHbbTV 1.3.20** or newer by Atos Worldline:

+ Start Mozilla Firefox
  + Select *open menu* (top right)
  + Select *Add-ons*
  + Search forFireHbbTV
  + Install FireHbbTV plug-in
+ Restart Mozilla Firefox
