# TimeLine

The TimeLine navigation model was designed to allow triggering of the appearance and 
disappearance of many pages on top of a video, based on various kinds of time/events.
As pages appear on top of a video, their background should be transparent.
The pages in a TimeLine are plain MPAT pages, see the WebSite navigation model and the
rest of this handbook for information on how to create and edit them.

In order to use the timeline editor, you have to select the TimeLine navigation model in the
MPAT Application Settings. Then the watch icon of the TimeLine editor appears in the left sidebar menu.
