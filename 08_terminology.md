# MPAT from A - Z

This glossary aims to explain the necessary terms and functions. Where appliccable, terms are linked with pages which offer more detailed descriptions.

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|---|---|
| **Application** | An application consists of *a)* 1-n pages, *b)* follows a Navigation Model |
| **Component** | A component is also referred to as content type and defines certain functionality that can be added to a page based on the selected Page Layout. For instance, a component can be an image canvas or image gallery, a video player, or a text field. |
| **CSS** | You can define general settings like font size and colours, border colours, etc. by entering CSS code in the Customizer. |
| **Customisation** | There are different kinds of general configurations like the global background image, font settings, the definition of a Start Page, and many others |
| **Focus** | In contrast to websites on a PC, you don’t navigate with a pointer device (e.g. a mouse) or your fingers on the touchscreen. In an HbbTV application you navigate with the arrow keys of your Remote Control. The point (menu button, component) where you currently are has the Focus. As a visual orientation it is recommended that the active component has a border to give the user some visual orientation. Borders (for active links, etc.) are best defined globally in the Customizer,but can also be defined per component. |
| **Frontpage** | The Frontpage is the first page or landing page of your application that the user will see. You define it in the Customizer by selecting one of the existing pages of your site. And don't forget to press "Publish". |
| **HotSpot** | In MPAT, a HotSpot is a component which activates content indirectly. E.g. if you want to play an audio or a video without a player canvas, you would put a HotSpot. The HotSpot is a media icon (currently text, audio or video) which changes its colour when it is in focus and changes its state when it is activated. |
| **Landing Page** | see Frontpage |
| **Menu**| MPAT offers different kinds of menus for your HbbTV applications: The component called "menu" defines the use of Remote Control keys, the so-called "Side Menu" is  a list menu displayed at the side of the page.|
| **Navigation Model** | The [Navigation Model](https://github.com/MPAT-eu/handbook/blob/master/01_general_information.md#application-design--navigation-models) defines how the user navigates between the pages of an application. Every application can only have one Navigation Model. It is possible, though, to interlink between applications so that, from a consumer perspective, an application may seem to follow different Navigation Models (in different areas of a service). |
| **Page** | Every application consists of 1-n Pages. The Content Creator decides on the number, order and the content of the pages. |
| **Page Layout** | Every page of an application is based on a Page Layout. Page Layouts are created and edited in their own WordPress category. A Page Layout defines the positioning of boxes, not which modules will appear in these boxes - usually the App Creator will foresee a certain component for each box, but it is the Content Editor’s choice what s/he wants to put there. |
| **Page Model** | A [Page Model](https://mpat-eu.github.io/handbook/10_using_pagemodels.html) is a template that an application manager would provide for editors. While the Page Layout does not pre-define which content component will be in which box, the Page Model defines certain deatils, such as components and formats for various boxes. |
| **Site** | In the MPAT-Editor each site represents a full HbbTV application. To avoid ambiguities, the term "website" should be replaced with "HbbTV Site" or “MP Application” (a Multi-Platform Application which is built with the Multi-Platform Application Toolkit, MPAT). |
| **Style Sheets** | see CSS.|
